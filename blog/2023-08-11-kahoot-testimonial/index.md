![Windmill Kahoot](./wm_kahoot.png)

I have been a software engineer at [Motimate](https://www.motimateapp.com/) for the last 5 years. We are based in Oslo and we are now part of [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/). While the brand Kahoot traditionnaly focuses on B2C, we target Enterprise clients.

I started using Windmill at the beginning of the year. It is now used on a daily basis through internal tools managed by all our teams.

## Choosing Windmill for Flexibility

My team was already using various tools before, such as [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/en-fr/billing) or <a href="https://zapier.com/" rel="nofollow">Zapier</a>. However, we were limited technically because these platforms are most useful if you proceed exactly as they want users to act.

Since we had our own use cases, we needed a flexible solution to create our internal tools.

At first, I turned to Windmill for workflows, as a replacement for Zapier, a mission that Windmill fulfilled perfectly. I then discovered the app builder, which is a golden opportunity for our operational teams to interact autonomously with our numerous integrations ([Stripe](https://hub.windmill.dev/integrations/stripe), [HubSpot](https://hub.windmill.dev/integrations/hubspot)).

Examples of what we have built with Windmill include:
- Billing: We integrated Stripe into an app, completely replacing Stripe Billing to align with our specific needs.
- Communication: We developed a personalized SMS sender.
- Customer success: as our CS team used [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/), we leveraged Windmil for translating, fetching, and insering articles into Zendesk using [OpenAI](https://hub.windmill.dev/integrations/openai) for new languages ([I shared this flow](https://hub.windmill.dev/flows/47/insert-zendesk-articles-into-supabase-with-openaiembedings) on WindmillHub).
  
Currently, we employ 9 apps, 20 flows, and 63 scripts in our daily operations. They all serve as the foundation for essential tasks, allowing users to independently manage their activities according to their specific needs.

## Planning to expand Windmill to more use cases and to less technical users

Looking ahead, our plan is to extend Windmill's usage to more use cases.

While I manage the back-office for now, we aim to involve more team members (less technical ones) to build customized internal tools autonomously.
