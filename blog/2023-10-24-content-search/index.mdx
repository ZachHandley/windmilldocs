# Launch Week Day X: Content Search

<br/>

![Content Search thumbnail](./code_search_thumbnail.png "Content Search thumbnail")

<br/>

We are excited to announce content search in Windmill. Much like [GitHub's code search](https://github.com/features/code-search), search for text in all scripts, flows, apps, or resources in the workspace.

Navigate, search, and delve into the code of your entire team, gaining greater visibility and control!

## How it works

From your workspace home page, click on "Content" and write the string you're looking for.
Windmill will return all matching content from scripts, flows, apps and resources, with specific tab for each.

All items are return with their [path](/docs/core_concepts/roles_and_permissions#path) and an Edit button leading to the specific item's editor.
