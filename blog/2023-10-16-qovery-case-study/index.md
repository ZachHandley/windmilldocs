# Windmill as an Airflow Alternative - Qovery Case Study

This is a testimonial written by [Romaric Philog√®ne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romaricphilogene/), CEO & Co-founder at Qovery.

## What before Windmill?

[Qovery](https://www.qovery.com/) is a modern infrastructure automation platform that simplifies the process of managing cloud infrastructure for DevOps, Platform and Engineering teams. It provides a set of tools and features that automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of infrastructure resources.

As software, many of our operations require taking into account a large set of data. This implies crucial automations (mostly ETLs triggered on a schedule) that cannot be handled by single softwares as our constraints are too specific. Therefore, we built several workflows with Airflow.

However, Airflow quickly became frustrating because ...

// Ruben or Romaric to write issues with Airflow

Windmill has been able to cover all these needs. We use Windmill as a platform to build, [schedule](/docs/core_concepts/scheduling), and monitor all of our scripts & flows. They offer a clear DX for code editing, [permission management](/docs/core_concepts/roles_and_permissions) and [error handling](/docs/core_concepts/error_handling). Additionally, they have an active community and responsive team.

Below are some use cases that we have built on Windmill.

## Recycle expired users

Some databases are no longer used by clients, and maintaining them is inefficient and costly. Therefore, we created a simple yet devilishly effective trigger flow that regularly monitors the use of databases, and if and only if one of them meets certain criteria, it will be cleaned up.

The killer feature here was the ability to easily combine schedules with the conditional execution of a series of tasks, what Windmill calls Trigger flows.

## Billing engine

Our billing engine is entirely calculated with Windmill. Specifically, at a given frequency, we have a Windmill flow that pings all of our clients to retrieve all of their metrics. This is a business-critical process and is quite complex since it requires managing numerous API calls.

Windmill has completely replaced Airflow for this use case.

Other use cases include:
- Synchronization of key users with Intercom
