## Start building your Discord bot in minutes with Windmill.

For developers working with Discord bots, Windmill's new Early Return feature is a practical solution to a common challenge: ensuring your bot responds quickly to commands, especially when dealing with complex workflows.

### The Challenge with Discord Bots

Discord requires bots to respond to commands within 3 seconds, which can be limiting when your bot needs to execute multiple steps.

### How early return helps

#### Immediate Response

When a Discord command triggers a Windmill workflow, the bot quickly processes the first step, adhering to Discord's response time limit.

#### Background Workflow Continuation

The rest of the workflow is then handled asynchronously, allowing your bot to complete more complex tasks without being constrained by the initial response time.

### Example

We've recently updated our blog post on the knowledge-based bot to include the implementation of the new Early Return feature. You can read about the update [here](/blog/knowledge-base-discord-bot)!
