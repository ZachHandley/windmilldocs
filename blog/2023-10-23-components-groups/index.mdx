# Launch Week Day X: Groups of Components

In the [App Editor](/docs/apps/app_editor), components are UI elements with specific appearance and behavior, which can be [linked to scripts or flows](/docs/apps/connecting_components).

Windmill provides over [sixty components](/docs/apps/app_configuration_settings/app_component_library) for its users, accessible with a simple drag-and-drop.

We are proud to introduce component groups, which allow you to build your own meta-components, accessible via drag-and-drop from any app in your workspace

## How it works

1. From the editor, pick a [container](/docs/apps/app_configuration_settings/container) component and enable "Container is a component group".
2. Create at least one group field.
3. Fill the group field's object, either manually or dynamically through an [eval](/docs/apps/app-runnable-panel#evals).
4. Now the container's components can be [connected](/docs/apps/connecting_components) to the group fields items through `group.group_field_name.optional_subitems`

Inside those "container groups", you can refer to "group.x" to refer to one of those group field which make this independent of the id of the container itself.

Component groups can be saved to workspace. They will be available from all workspace apps as a component under the "Groups" category. They saved as resources, under the `app_groups` [folder](/docs/core_concepts/groups_and_folders).
