# Launch Week Day 1: VSCode Extension

Welcome to the first day of the first launch week of Windmill. To follow all the announcements made this week, please go to the [Launch Week #1](../2023-11-15-launch-week-1/index.mdx) page.

One of the features announced today is the Windmill [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=windmill-labs.windmill). It allows you to build your scripts and flows from your code editor with the traditional Windmill UI preview, and to synchronize everything with the workspace.

## Why a VS Code Extension

Windmill has its own IDE for creating [scripts](/docs/script_editor) and [flows](/docs/flows/flow_editor) from the Windmill application (cloud or [self-hosted](/docs/advanced/self_host)).

But some developers have their habits, and we don't want to take that away from them. So, we brought Windmill to VS Code with an extension that parses your documents (scripts and YAML for flows) and generates an [interactive UI page](/docs/core_concepts/auto_generated_uis) to test your scripts & flows using all your Windmill resources and variables.

## How It Works

1. Install the [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=windmill-labs.windmill).
2. Enter your Windmill remote URL and [token](/docs/core_concepts/webhooks#user-token), so the extension can execute scripts and flows on your workspace.
3. From any script file, use `> Windmill: Run preview in the current editor` or Ctrl+Enter and Shift+Enter to generate the UI preview (provided that the script meets the few rules required by Windmill).

In principle, this is enough. However, your extension will be much more powerful if you use it on a [repository synchronized to a Windmill instance](/docs/advanced/cli/sync), thanks to [Windmill CLI](/docs/advanced/cli). For flows, this has the advantage of having them directly in a YAML format readable by the extension.
