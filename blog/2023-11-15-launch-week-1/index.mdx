# Windmill Launch Week #1

![Launch Week Thumbnail](./launch_week.png)

Welcome to Windmill's first Launch Week!

During the week of November 20, 2023, every day we will announce features that make Windmill even more reliable, faster, and easier to use.

A summary will be updated progressively on this page.

## Day 1 - Flow Builder Copilot

<br />

The very first feature of this launch week is Windmill Flow Copilot AI. The Copilot AI can generate the full flow including the code from a few prompts but also do it step-by-step.

It saves time for all users by returning a usable version of the flow in seconds, while leaving room for customization as each step is in the form of code.
For less technical users, it's an opportunity to use Windmill while avoiding back-and-forth with Chat-GPT.

## Day 1 - VS Code Extension

Second annoucement of the day is the Windmill [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=windmill-labs.windmill).
It unlocks fully the ability to iterate on your scripts and flows in the comfort of your VS Code editor. It integrates particularly well with the current github/gitlab sync: scripts', flow steps' code and flows' yaml definitions can be directly edited in VS Code while benefitting from the instant preview UI of windmill.

## Day 2 - Worker Groups Management UI & Hot Reloading

[Worker Groups Management UI & Hot Reloading](../2023-11-21-a-workers-group/worker_groups_configuration_thumbnail.png 'Worker Groups')

[Blog post](../2023-11-21-a-workers-group/index.mdx)

Today's first annoucement of the day is the power of Worker Groups Configurations UI Management & Hot Reloading.

[Workers](/docs/core_concepts/worker_groups) are the foundation of Windmill. They are autonomous processes that run one script at a time using the entire cpu and memory available to them.

By default, every worker is the same and interchangeable.
However, there are often needs to assign jobs to a specific worker pool, and to configure this worker pool to behave specifically or have different pre-installed binaries.
To that end, we introduce the concept of "worker groups".

You can assign worker groups to flows and flow steps to be executed on specific queues, and for workers to only process jobs coming from specific queues.

Examples of worker groups configurations include:

- [Assign different jobs to specific worker groups](/docs/core_concepts/worker_groups) by giving them tags.
- [Set an init script](/docs/advanced/preinstall_binaries#init-scripts) that will run at the start of the workers (e.g. to pre-install binaries).
- [Dedicate your worker to a specific script or flow](/docs/core_concepts/dedicated_workers), for high throughput.

Once the configurations are done from the Windmill UI, the workers take their configuration dynamically, without having to restart.

## Day 2 - Dedicated Workers for scripts

[Dedicated Workers for scripts](../2023-11-21-dedicated-workers/dedicated_workers_thumbnail.png 'Dedicated Workers for Scripts')

[Blog post](https://www.windmill.dev/blog/launch-week-dedicated-workers)

Dedicated Workers for scripts enable to reach up to 1000rps per worker for a given script. It makes windmill faster than AWS Lambda and a good fit for even event-streaming use cases.
