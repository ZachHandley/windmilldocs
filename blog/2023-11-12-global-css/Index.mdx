# Launch Week Day 1: Global Custom CSS

Custom styling is essential for aligning internal tools with your brand image. While component-level CSS has always been possible in Windmill App Editor, we are excited to introduce global CSS.

The Global CSS Editor is designed to give styling and theming across your apps. It provides a centralized location for defining, managing, and applying CSS rules. With this feature, you can ensure consistent styling and create reusable themes for different teams, projects, or clients.

## How it works

<iframe
	width="560"
	height="315"
	src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_MjKgbdCFQ?vq=hd1080"
	title="YouTube video player"
	frameborder="0"
	allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
	allowfullscreen="true"
></iframe>

<br/>

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open the App Editor.
2. Navigate to the Global Styling tab.
3. Fork the default theme.

For finer control, specific [class identifiers](/docs/apps/css_editor#class-identifiers) have been added to each component, such as `wm-container` and `wm-button`.

Choose a class and apply CSS to it. Then, from the "Theme" menu, save your configuration in a theme of your choice, ready to use off-the-shelf.

You can also transfer the configuration defined on a component to the global level, affecting all components of that type.

The Global CSS Editor is a feature exclusive to [Cloud & Enterprise Self-Hosted](/pricing).
