# Styling

Styling on the app editor can be managed at the component and app-level.

## Component level

### Pre-set

Some components have pre-set options for styling. They can be configured from the `Components settings` tab in the `Configuration` section.

### Styling Menu

Components come with a styling menu. From there, pick styles either from [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp) or [Tailwind classes](https://tailwind.build/classes).

Please note that these different style classes can be combined.

### Rich Editor

You can configure manually your own classes with our Rich Editor.

    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
    autoPlay
    controls
    src="/videos/rich_editor.mp4"
/>

Elements like background color (incl. shadow, opacity), border (incl. stlye, radius), typography (incl. font size, family, weight, spacing) etc. can all be configured for each component.

## Global Styling

For complex apps, you may not want to repeat the styling configuration on each component.

### CSS Editor

The [Global CSS Editor](../../misc/15_css_editor/index.md) is designed to give styling and theming across your entire app. This functionality offers a centralized location for defining, managing, and applying CSS rules. It's useful for ensuring consistent styling and for creating reusable themes.

The Global CSS Editor is a feature exclusive to [Enterprise Edition](../../misc/7_plans_details/index.mdx). However, users on the Community Edition can still access and experiment with this tool directly in the editor for evaluation purposes, although these changes will not be reflected in the app preview.

  className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
  autoPlay
  controls
  src="/videos/global-css.mp4"
/>

<br/>

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 my-4">
	<DocCard
		title="CSS Editor"
		description="The Global CSS Editor is designed to give styling and theming across your entire app."
		href="/docs/misc/css_editor"
		color="orange"
	/>
</div>

### Configure manually and replicate pre-set styling

Styling on a component level can be replicated to all the components of the same class from the Rich Editor.

Just click on `Convert to global CSS`.
