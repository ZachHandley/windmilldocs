# Runnables

On the bottom of the app editor, you can find the runnable editor. It allows you to create, edit or manage the scripts or flows linked to components (Runnable), and background scripts.

They are 4 types of runnables:

- **Inline scripts**: scripts that are defined on the app editor, linked to a component.
- **Workspace/Hub**: scripts linked to a component, but defined in the workspace or the Hub.
- **Background scripts**: scripts that are not linked to a component, but run in the background.
- **Frontend scripts**: script can be used to manipulate the client app state. They can either be linked to a component or be a background script. If they are a background script, they are not executed unless manually set to run when the app starts or reloads.
