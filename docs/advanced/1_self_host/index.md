# Self Host Windmill

For small setup, use docker and docker compose on a single instance.
For larger and production use-cases, use our [helm chart](#helm-chart) to deploy on kubernetes.

The default credentials are admin@windmill.dev / changeme. From there you can easily setup another account as part of the setup step.

**Even if you setup oauth, login as** admin@windmill.dev **/ changeme to setup the instance and give yourself admin privileges.**

## Docker

### Setup Windmill on localhost

<video 
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full"
    controls
    id="app-text-inline-editor"
    src="/videos/self_host.mp4"
/>

<br/>

> _Self-host Windmill in less than a minute._

<br/>

Using Docker and Caddy, Windmill can be deployed using two files,
([`docker-compose.yml`][windmill-docker-compose] and
[`Caddyfile`][windmill-caddyfile]) and in a single command.

[Caddy][caddy] takes care of managing the TLS certificate and the reverse proxy,
Postgres of storage, Windmill-LSP provides editor intellisense. All managed by
one [`docker-compose.yml`][windmill-docker-compose] file.

Make sure docker is started (Mac: `open /Applications/Docker.app`, Windows: `start docker`, Linux: `sudo systemctl start docker`) and type the following commands:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/Caddyfile -o Caddyfile
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/.env -o .env

docker compose up -d --pull always
```

Go to [http://localhost](http://localhost) et voilÃ !

The default super-admin user is: admin@windmill.dev / `changeme`.

From there, you can follow the setup app to replace the superadmin account and schedule a sync of resources (by default, everyday).

We recommend setting up [SSO with OAuth](../../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.md) if you can to avoid manually adding users. If not possible, you can add new users manually:

![Add new users](./adding_new_user.gif 'Add new users')

> _Add new users to your instance._

<br/>

When creating a workspace, you have the option to invite automatically everyone on the same domain. That's how you make sure that anyone added to the instance is also added to the workspace.

<video 
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full"
    controls
    id="app-text-inline-editor"
    src="/videos/new_workspace.mp4"
/>

<br/>

> _Create a new workspace._

<br/>

### Admins Workspace

What distinguishes the admin workspace from other workspaces is that its [resource types](../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.md) are shared with all workspaces.

If you skipped the instance setup or need to sync resource types, you can go to the admins workspace and run the _Synchronize Hub Resource types with instance_ script, or [schedule](../../core_concepts/1_scheduling/index.md) it.

![Sync resource types](./sync_resource_types.gif 'Sync resource types with Hub')

<br/>

For more advanced setups, see below.

### Configuring Domain and Reverse Proxy

Let's assume you wish to deploy Windmill to the `windmill.example.com` domain.
This information only needs to be propagated to the `docker-compose.yml` file,
using the `WM_BASE_URL` environment variable.

Create/edit the `.env` file at the root of the project and set your desired
address:

```bash
# .env
DB_PASSWORD=supersecret
WM_BASE_URL=http://windmill.example.com
```

Setting the `WM_BASE_URL` configures Windmill to use it as its base url. You still need to configure a reverse proxy to hit windmill and windmill-lsp on the right ports. You can use any reverse proxy as long as they behave mostly like the following caddy configuration:

```
:80 {
        bind {$ADDRESS}
        reverse_proxy /ws/* http://lsp:3001
        reverse_proxy /* http://windmill_server:8000
}
```

The default docker-compose file exposes a caddy reverse-proxy on port 80, configured by the [caddyfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/Caddyfile) curled above. Configure both the caddyfile and the docker-compose file to fit your needs. The documentation for caddy is available [here](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile).

#### Traefik configuration

### Deployment

Once you have setup your environment for deployment, you can run the following
command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

That's it! Head over to your domain and you should be greeted with the login
screen.

:::tip

Default e-mail is `admin@windmill.dev` and the password is `changeme`.

:::

### Update

To update to a newer version of Windmill, all you have to do is run:

```bash
docker compose pull
```

Or in case you wish to update only the Windmill image, run:

```bash
docker compose pull windmill
```

Database volume is persistent, so updating the database image is safe too.

### Reset your instance

Windmill stores all of its state in PostgreSQL and it is enough to reset the database to reset the instance.
Hence, in the setup above, to reset your Windmill instance, it is enough to reset the PostgreSQL volumes. run:

```
docker compose volumes down
docker volume rm -f windmill_db_data
```

and then `docker compose up`.

## Helm Chart

We also provide a convenient [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/)
for Kubernetes-based self-hosted set-up.

Detailed instructions can be found in the [README][helm-readme] file in the
[official repository][helm] of the chart.

:::tip

If you're familiar with Helm and want to jump right in, you can deploy quickly
with the snippet below.

```bash
# add the Windmill helm repo
helm repo add windmill https://windmill-labs.github.io/windmill-helm-charts/
# install chart with default values
helm install windmill-chart windmill/windmill  \
      --namespace=windmill             \
      --create-namespace
```

Detailed instructions in the official [repository][helm].

:::

### Enterprise deployment with Helm

The Enterprise edition of Windmill uses different base images and supports
additional features. One important feature is better caching for dependencies in a
super cache supported by S3.

You need:

- an Enterprise license key
- an AWS account and S3 bucket
- AWS credentials or IAM roles prepared for access from the Windmill worker pods.
  <br/>

See the [Helm Chart repository README][helm] [repository][helm] for more details. The exact setup
for S3 access will vary according to your environment.

## Compile from source

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder ([source][windmill-gh-frontend]) and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run generate-backend-client
   // on mac use: npm run generate-backend-client-mac
   npm run build
   ```
2. Install the [LLD Linker](https://lld.llvm.org/).
3. Go to `backend` folder ([source][windmill-gh-backend]) and run:
   ```bash
   SQLX_OFFLINE=true cargo build --release
   ```
4. The Windmill binary will be at `target/release/windmill`

You can run it with the following command:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url> ./windmill
```

Windmill binary will make the assumption that NsJail is in `PATH`, Python3 is
available at `/usr/local/bin/python3` and Deno at `/usr/bin/deno`. It will also
assume that you are connected to PostgreSQL using a superuser. If you cannot use
a superuser, see the following section.

## Run Windmill without using a Postgres superuser

Create the database with your non-super user as owner:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE windmill OWNER nonsuperuser
```

As a superuser, create the windmill_user and windmill_admin roles with the
proper privileges, using:

```bash
psql <DATABASE_URL> -f init-db-as-superuser.sql
```

where `init-db-as-superuser.sql` is
[this file](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/blob/main/init-db-as-superuser.sql).

Then finally, run the following commands:

```sql
GRANT windmill_admin TO nonsuperuser;
GRANT windmill_user TO nonsuperuser;
```

**NOTE: Make sure the roles `windmill_admin` and `windmill_user` have access to the database and the schema:**

You can ensure this by running the following commands as superuser while inside the database. Replace the schema
name `public` with your schema, in case you use a different one:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO windmill_admin;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO windmill_user;
```

## Complete New Windmill Setup

In the Admin Workspace execute the New User Setup App. This will import the default resources from WindmillHub and update the default user credentails
