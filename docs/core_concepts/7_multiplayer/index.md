From a script, just toggle `Multiplayer`, invite other members and start writing scripts in collaboration!

This feature is only available in the [self-hosted Enterprise Edition](../../misc/7_upgrade/index.md#enterprise-edition) and the [Windmill Cloud](../../getting_started/00_how_to_use_windmill/index.md#use-windmill-cloud) version.
