# Multiplayer

Multiplayer mode lets you work on scripts simultaneously with members of your team.

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full"
    autoPlay
    controls
    id="main-video"
    src="/videos/multiplayer.mp4"
/>

<br/>

From a script, just toggle `Multiplayer`, invite other members and start writing scripts together!
