# Flow Editor

Windmill's Flow Editor allows you to build flows with a low-code builder.

:::info Workflows

A workflow is a series of connected tasks, events, or processes that occur automatically to achieve a specific goal. These tasks are organized as a sequence of actions or steps: [scripts](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/1_typescript_quickstart/index.md) in the case of Windmill.

The Flow Builder has the following major components we will detail in a [dedicated page](3_editor_components.md):

- [Toolbar](./3_editor_components.md#toolbar): the toolbar allows you to export the flow, configure the flow settings, and test the flow.
- [Settings](./3_editor_components.md#settings): configure the flow settings.
- [Static Inputs](./3_editor_components.md#static-inputs): view all flow static inputs.
- [Flow Inputs](./3_editor_components.md#flow-inputs): view all flow inputs.
- [Action](./3_editor_components.md#flow-actions): steps are the building blocks of a flow. They are the actions that will be executed when the flow is run.
- [Action editor](./3_editor_components.md#action-editor): configure the action.
