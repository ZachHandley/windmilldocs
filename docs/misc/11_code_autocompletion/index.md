# Auto-Complete Code with AI

With minimum effort, you can use AI help to complete code on Windmill, and gain time, skills and reliability.

## Codeium

[Codeium](https://codeium.com/) is a code acceleration toolkit built on AI technology. In particular, Codeium has a free [browser extension](https://codeium.com/download) that works as a code completion assistant.

    autoPlay

    id="main-video"
    src="/videos/codeium_example.mp4"
/>

<br/>

Here is how to install the extention on Chrome (details [here](https://codeium.com/chrome_tutorial)):
1. Install the [extention](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codeium-ai-code-autocompl/hobjkcpmjhlegmobgonaagepfckjkceh).
2. Sign in to Codeium using  an e-mail or Google.
3. If it works, you should see the Codeium extention turn green.
4. To have it work on Windmill, add it to your Codeium allowlist:
    - Click on Codeium extention icon.
    - Select `Open Options Page`.
    - In the Allowlist, write `https:\/\/app\.windmill\.dev\/.*` (or your domain, if self-hosting).
    - `Save Allowlist`.

Now you're good to have Codeium suggest code in Windmill's code editor (scripts, flows, apps).

The code will auto-suggest, and if you like it, press on `tab` to accept.

You can help it by giving proper functions names:

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full"
    controls
    id="main-video"
    src="/videos/codeium_function.mp4"
/>

<br/>

Or by writing comments:

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full"
    controls
    id="main-video"
    src="/videos/codeium_comments.mp4"
/>

:::caution

Please note that the code suggested by Codeidum is not specific to Windmill and therefore does not necessarily meet its requirements (exposing a main function and declaring dependencies in the same file).
