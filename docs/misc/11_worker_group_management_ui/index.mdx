# Worker Groups Management UI

Workers are autonomous processes that run one script at a time using the full
machines resources available to them. They are at the basis of [Windmill's architecture](../10_architecture/index.md).

Under an [Enterprise license](../7_plans_details/index.mdx), worker groups can be managed through Windmill UI.
