# TypeScript Quickstart

In this quick start guide, we will write our first script in TypeScript. Windmill uses [Deno](https://deno.land/) as the TypeScript runtime.

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
    autoPlay
    loop
    controls
    id="main-video"
    src="/videos/typescrit_quickstart.mp4"
/>

<br/>

Scripts are the basic building blocks in Windmill. They can be [run and scheduled](../../8_trigger_scripts/index.md) as standalone, chained together to create [Flows][flows] or displayed with a personalized User Interface as [Apps](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

Scripts consist of 2 parts:

- **Code**: for typescript scripts, it must have at least a main function.
- **Metadata**: metadata about the Script such as its path, summary, description, [jsonschema](../../../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.md) of its inputs (inferred from its signature)

When stored in a code repository, those 2 parts are stored separately at `<path>.ts` and `<path>.script.yaml`

Scripts are immutable and there is an hash for each deployment of a given script. Scripts are never overwritten and referring to a script by path is referring to the latest deployed hash at that path.

For each script, a UI is autogenerated from the jsonchema inferred from the script signature, and can be customized further as standalone or embedded into rich UIs using the [App builder](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx)

In addition to the UI, sync and async webhooks are generated for each deployment.

[This](https://hub.windmill.dev/scripts/gmail/1291/-send-email-gmail) is a simple example of a script built in TypeScript with Windmill.

In this quick start guide, we'll create a script that greets the operator running it.

From the **Home** page, click `+Script`. This will take you to the
first step of script creation: Metadata.

![New script](./create_script_ts.png)

## Metadata

- **Path** is the Script's unique identifier that consist of the
  [script's owner](../../../reference/index.mdx#owner), and the script's name.
  The owner can be either a user, or a group ([folder](../../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.md#folders)).
- **Summary** (optional) is a short, human-readable summary of the Script. It
  will be displayed as a title across Windmill. If omitted, the UI will use the `path` by
  default.
- **Language** of the script. Windmill supports TypeScript, Python,
  Go, Bash and SQL. Let's pick TypeScript!
- **Description**: this is where you can give instructions
  to users on how to run your Script. It supports markdown!
- **[Worker group tag](../../../core_concepts/9_worker_groups/index.md)**, if you want to run some scripts on a GPU machine.

Now click on the code editor on the left side, and let's build our "Hello World"!

## Code

**Windmill gives you an online editor** to work on your Scripts. The left-side is
the editor itself. The right-side lets you **preview the UI** that Windmill will
generate from the Script's signature - this will be visible to the users of the
Script. You can easily preview that UI, provide input values, and test your
script there.

Note that you can have [AI suggest code on Windmill](../../../misc/11_code_autocompletion/index.md):

<br/>

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
    controls
    id="main-video"
    src="/videos/codeium_example.mp4"
/>

:::

As we picked `typescript` for this example, Windmill provided some TypeScript
boilerplate. Let's take a look:

```typescript
// Ctrl+. to cache dependencies on imports hover, Ctrl+S to format.

// import { toWords } from "npm:number-to-words@1"
// import * as wmill from "https://deno.land/x/windmill@v1.89.1/mod.ts"

export async function main(
	a: number,
	b: 'my' | 'enum',
	d = 'inferred type string from default arg',
	c = { nested: 'object' }
	//e: wmill.Base64
) {
	// let x = await wmill.getVariable('u/user/foo')
	return { foo: a };
}
```

In Windmill, scripts need to have a `main` function that will be the script's
entrypoint. There are a few important things to note about the `main`.

- The main arguments are used for generating 1. the input spec of the Script, and 2.
  the frontend that you see when running the Script as a standalone app.
- Type annotations are used to generate the UI form, and help pre-validate
  inputs. While not mandatory, they are highly recommended. You can customize
  the UI in later steps (but not change the input type!).

Also take a look at the [import](../../../advanced/6_imports/index.md) statement lines that are commented out. You can
use NPM imports directly in Windmill. The last import line imports the Windmill
client, that is needed for example, to access
[variables](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.md) or
[resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.md). We won't go
into that here.

Back to our "Hello World". We can clear up unused import statements, change the
main to take in the user's name. Let's also return the `name`, maybe we can use
this later if we use this Script within a Flow and need to pass it on.

```typescript
export async function main(name: string) {
	console.log("Hello world! Oh, it's you %s? Greetings!", name);
	return { name };
}
```

Look at the UI preview on the right: it was updated to match the input
signature. Run a test (`Ctrl` + `Enter`) to verify everything works.

You can change how the UI behaves by changing the main signature. For example,
if you add a default for the `name` argument, the UI won't consider this field
as required anymore.

```typescript
main(name: string = "you")
```

Now let's go to the last step: the "Customise" settings.

## Customize Settings

In this step, you can:

- Give a **script kind**: Action (by default), [Trigger](../../../flows/10_flow_trigger.md), [Approval](../../../flows/11_flow_approval.md) or [Error Handler](../../../flows/7_flow_error_handler.md). This acts as a tag to filter appropriate scripts from the [flow editor](../../6_flows_quickstart/index.md).
- Customize the script's **Arguments**. The UI is generated from the Script's main function signature, but you can add additional constraints here. For example, we could use the `Customize property`: add a regex by clicking on `Pattern` to make sure users are providing a name with only alphanumeric characters: `^[A-Za-z0-9]+$`. Let's still allow numbers in case you are some tech billionaire's kid.

![Advanced settings for TypeScript](./customize_ts.png)

We're done! Save your script. Note that Scripts are versioned in Windmill, and
each script version is uniquely identified by a hash.

## Run!

Now let's look at what users of the script will do. Click on the **[Deploy](../../../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.md)** button
to load the script. You'll see the user input form we defined earlier.

Fill in the input field, then hit "Run". You should see a run view, as well as
your logs. All script runs are also available in the [Runs][app-runs] menu on
the left.

![Run hello world in TypeScript](./run_ts.png)

You can also chose to [run the script from the CLI](../../../advanced/3_cli/index.mdx) with the pre-made Command-Line Interface call.

## What's next?

This script is a minimal working example, but there's a few more steps we need
in a real-world use case:

- Pass
  [variables and secrets](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.md)
  to a script.
- Connect to [resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.md).
- [Trigger that script](../../8_trigger_scripts/index.md) in many ways.
- Compose scripts in [Flows][flows] or [Apps](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).
- You can [share your scripts](../../../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md) with the community on [Windmill Hub][wm-hub]. Once
  submitted, they will be verified by moderators before becoming available to
  everyone right within Windmill.
