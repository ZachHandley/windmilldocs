# Go Quickstart

In this quick start guide, we will write our first script in Go.
Scripts are the basic building blocks in Windmill. They can be [run and scheduled](../../8_trigger_scripts/index.md) as standalone, chained together to create [Flows][flows] or displayed with a personalized UI as [Apps](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.md).

Scripts consist of 2 parts:

- **Code**: for go scripts, it must have at least a main function.
- **Metadata**: metadata about the Script such as its path, summary, description, [jsonschema](../../../reference/index.md#json-schema) of its inputs (inferred from its signature)

When stored in a code repository, these two parts are stored separately at `<path>.ts` and `<path>.script.yaml`

Scripts are immutable and there is an hash for each deployment of a given script. Scripts are never overwritten and referring to a script by path is referring to the latest deployed hash at that path.

There is no need to specify additionally the requirements/dependencies, they are inferred automatically alongside the lockfile using `go mod tidy`.

For each script, a UI is autogenerated from the jsonchema inferred from the script signature, and can be customized further as standalone or embedded into rich UIs using the [App builder](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.md).

In addition to the UI, sync and async webhooks are generated for each deployment.

In this quick start guide, we'll create a script that greets the operator running it.

From the **Home** page, click `+Script`. This will take you to the
first step of script creation: Metadata.

## Metadata

- **Path** is the Script's unique identifier that consist of the
  [script's owner](../../../reference/index.md#owner), and the script's name.
  The owner can be either a user, or a group ([folder](../../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.md#folders)).
- **Summary** (optional) is a short, human-readable summary of the Script. It
  will be displayed as a title across Windmill. If omitted, the UI will use the `path` by
  default.
- **Language** the language of the script. Windmill supports TypeScript, Python,
  Go, Bash and SQL. Let's pick Python!
- **Description**: this is where you can give instructions
  to users on how to run your Script. It supports markdown!
- **[Worker group tag](../../../core_concepts/9_worker_groups/index.md)**, if you want to run some scripts on a GPU machine.

Now click on the code editor on the left side, and let's build our Hello World!

## Code

**Windmill gives you an online editor** to work on your Scripts. The left-side is
the editor itself. The right-side lets you **preview the UI** that Windmill will
generate from the Script's signature - this will be visible to the users of the
Script. You can easily preview that UI, provide input values, and test your
script there.

Note that you can have [AI suggest code on Windmill](../../../misc/11_code_autocompletion/index.md):

    src="/videos/codeium_example.mp4"
/>

As we picked `go` for this example, Windmill provided some Go
boilerplate. Let's take a look:

```go
package inner

import (
	"fmt"
	"rsc.io/quote"
	// wmill "github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-go-client"
)

// the main must return (interface{}, error)

func main(x string, nested struct {
	Foo string `json:"foo"`
}) (interface{}, error) {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World")
	fmt.Println(nested.Foo)
	fmt.Println(quote.Opt())
	// v, _ := wmill.GetVariable("f/examples/secret")
	return x, nil
}

```

In Windmill, scripts need to have a `main` function that will be the script's
entrypoint. There are a few important things to note about the `main`.

- The main arguments are used for generating 1. the input spec of the Script, and 2.
  the frontend that you see when running the Script as a standalone app.
- Type annotations are used to generate the UI form, and help pre-validate
  inputs. While not mandatory, they are highly recommended. You can customize
  the UI in later steps (but not change the input type!).

The last import line imports the Windmill
client, that is needed for example to access
[variables](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.md) or
[resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.md). We won't go
into that here.

Back to our Hello World. We can clear up unused import statements, change the
main to take in the user's name. Let's also return the `name`, maybe we can use
this later if we use this Script within a Flow and need to pass it on.

```go
package inner

import (
	"fmt"
	"rsc.io/quote"
)

func main(x string, nested struct {
	Foo string `json:"foo"`
}) (interface{}, error) {
	fmt.Println(nested.Foo)
	fmt.Println(quote.Opt())
	return ("Hello world. Oh, it's you " + x + "? Greetings!"), nil
}
```

Look at the UI preview on the right: it was updated to match the input
signature. Run a test to verify everything works.

Now let's go to the last step: the "Customise" settings.

## Customize Settings

In this step, you can:

- Give a **script kind**: Action (by default), [Trigger](../../../flows/10_flow_trigger.md), [Approval](../../../flows/11_flow_approval.md) or [Error Handler](../../../flows/7_flow_error_handler.md). This acts as a tag to filter appropriate scripts from the [flow editor](../../6_flows_quickstart/index.md).
- Customize the script's **Arguments**. The UI is generated from the Script's main function signature, but you can add additional constraints here. For example, we could use the `Customize property`: add a regex by clicking on `Pattern` to make sure users are providing a name with only alphanumeric characters: `^[A-Za-z0-9]+$`. Let's still allow numbers in case you are some tech billionaire's kid.

![Advanced settings for Go](./customize_go.png)

We're done! Save your script. Note that Scripts are versioned in Windmill, and
each script version is uniquely identified by a hash.

## Run!

Now let's look at what users of the script will do. Click on the **[Deploy](../../../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.md)** button
to load the script. You'll see the user input form we defined earlier.

Fill in the input field, then hit "Run". You should see a run view, as well as
your logs. All script runs are also available in the [Runs][app-runs] menu on
the left.

![Run Hello World in Go](./run_go.png)

You can also chose to [run the script from the CLI](../../../advanced/3_cli/index.mdx) with the pre-made Command-Line Interface call.

## What's next?

This script is a minimal working example, but there's a few more steps we need
in a real-world use case:

- Pass
  [variables and secrets](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.md)
  to a script.
- Connect to [resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.md).
- [Trigger that script](../../8_trigger_scripts/index.md) in many ways.
- Compose scripts in [Flows][flows] or [Apps](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.md).
- You can [share your scripts](../../../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md) with the community on [Windmill Hub][wm-hub]. Once
  submitted, they will be verified by moderators before becoming available to
  everyone right within Windmill.
