# Triggering Scripts

Scripts can be triggered in 6 ways.

On-demand triggers:
- [Auto-generated UIs](#auto-generated-uis)
- [Customized UIs with the App Editor](#customized-uis-with-the-app-editor)
- [Trigger Scripts from Flows](#trigger-scripts-from-flows) that have their [own ways of triggering](../9_trigger_flows/index.md)
- [Trigger Scripts from CLI (Command Line Interface)](#trigger-scripts-from-cli-command-line-interface)
- [Schedule the Execution of a Script](#schedule-the-execution-of-a-script)

Triggers from external events:
- [Trigger Scripts from Webhooks](#trigger-scripts-from-webhooks)


:::info Scripts in Windmill

[Scripts](../0_scripts_quickstart/1_typescript_quickstart/index.md) are sequences of instructions that automates tasks or performs specific operations. In Windmill, they are hosted on workspaces.

## On-demand triggers

### Auto-generated UIs

Windmill automatically generates user interfaces (UIs) for scripts and flows based on their parameters.

By analyzing the main function parameters, it creates an input specification in the JSON Schema format, which is then used to render the UI. Users do not need to interact with the JSON Schema directly, as Windmill simplifies the process and allows for optional UI customization.

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full"
    loop
    controls
    id="main-video"
    src="/videos/auto_generated_uis.mp4"
/>

<br/>

This feature is also usable directly in the script editor to **test a script in the making**:

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full"
    loop
    controls
    id="main-video"
    src="/videos/ui_from_script_editor.mp4"
/>

<br/>

### Customized UIs with the App Editor

Windmill embeds a WYSIWYG app editor. It allows you to build your own UI with drag-and-drop components and to connect your data to scripts and flows in minutes.

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full"
    loop
    controls
    id="main-video"
    src="/videos/app_editor_fast.mp4"
/>

<br/>

### Trigger Scripts from Flows

Flows are basically sequences of scripts that execute on after each other or [in parallel](../../flows/13_flow_branches.md#branch-all).

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full"
    loop
    controls
    id="main-video"
    src="/videos/crm-automation-execution.mp4"
/>

<br/>

:::

### Schedule the Execution of a Script

Windmill allows you to schedule scripts using a user-friendly interface and control panels, **similar to [cron](https://crontab.guru/)** but with more features.

You can create schedules by specifying a script or flow, its arguments, and a CRON expression to control the execution frequency, ensuring that your tasks run automatically at the desired intervals.

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full"
    loop
    controls
    id="main-video"
    src="/videos/schedule-cron-menu.mp4"
/>

<br/>

### Trigger Scripts from CLI (Command Line Interface)

The `wmill` cli allows you to interact with Windmill instances right from your terminal.

## Triggers from external events

### Trigger Scripts from Webhooks

In Windmill, webhooks are autogenerated for each Script and Flow, providing either asynchronous or synchronous execution modes. 

These webhooks accept incoming HTTP requests, allowing users to easily trigger their Windmill workflows from external services by simply sending a POST request to the appropriate webhook URL. Their purpose is to have the script run when it receives an input from its associated webhook.

:::tip Example of triggering Windmill through a webhook on Github

Each script (and flow) has its own webhooks on Windmill ...

![Find Windmill webhook](../../../blog/2023-02-06-flow-triage-bot/tutorial-find-webhook.png)

<br/>

... which you can trigger from service providers, like Github [here](https://docs.windmill.dev/blog/issue-triage-bot-flow):
