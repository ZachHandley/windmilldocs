# Get Started with Windmill

Windmill is fully [open-source](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill). Therefore, we want it to be as easy to use as possible.

### Self-Host Windmill

You can choose to self-host Windmill on your own servers.

[Windmill's GitHub repository](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill) contains all the necessary files to
run Windmill locally, or to self-host it. We encourage Docker-based deployments, and provide a `docker-compose` file to
help you get started.

For detailed information, follow the **[Self Host Windmil tutorial](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/self_host/)**.

### Use Windmill Cloud

Windmill provides a **[Cloud App](https://app.windmill.dev/user/login)** that everyone can use.

You can sign-up using your GitHub, GitLab, Google, Microsoft or email. No Credit Cards required and we will spare your inbox.

Any user will be provided with 1,000 monthly executions from our [Free plan](https://www.windmill.dev/pricing/) and added to the Demo workspace. From there, users can create workspaces for free and create scripts, workflows and UIs.

And if you feel like it, [upgrade](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/misc/upgrade/) for unlimited executions.

## Where to Start?

Windmill is a multi-faceted platform that allows you to build endpoints, workflows & UIs. Each of these features can be used as a standalone feature and their own logic can be understood independently.

However all features on Windmill are highly compatible and rely on scripts that are the smallest "unit" for building workflows and UIs, due to their flexibility and control.

If you don't know where to start, here are a few recommendations:
- Have a look at our quickstarts (on [Scripts](../../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/1_typescript_quickstart/index.md), [Flows](../6_flows_quickstart/index.md) or [Apps](../7_apps_quickstart/index.md)) that give an introduction on how to build your first ones.
- Check how to [trigger scripts](../8_trigger_scripts/index.md) and [flows](../9_trigger_flows/index.md) to get an idea of what you could do with Windmill.
- Play with Windmill: [Cloud App](#use-windmill-cloud) or [Self-Hosting](#self-host-windmill). Our cloud Demo workspace showcases some speaking examples.
- Browse [Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/) and explore templates shared by the community.
