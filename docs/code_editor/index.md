# Code Editor

The code editor is Windmill's integrated development environment. It allows you to write code in TypeScript, Python, Go, Bash, SQL, or even running any docker container through Windmill's Bash support.

The code editor is the main component for building scripts in Windmill's script editor, but it is also used in Windmill's Flow Editor to build steps or in the App Editor to add inline scripts.
