# Custom Environment Variables

In a self-hosted environment, Windmill allows you to set custom environment variables for your scripts. This feature is useful when a script needs an environment variable prior to the main function executing itself. For instance, some libraries in Go do some setup in the 'init' function that depends on environment variables.

To add a custom environment variable to a script in Windmill, you should follow this format: `<KEY>=<VALUE>`. Where `<KEY>` is the name of the environment variable and `<VALUE>` is the corresponding value of the environment variable.

## Request headers

It is possible for jobs to take request headers as arguments. To do so, either specify in the query args the headers to process at `include_headers`, separated with `,`. e.g: `/api/w/admins/jobs/run_wait_result/p/u/user/undisputed_script?include_header=X-Sign,foo`

or use the env variable: `INCLUDE_HEADERS` with the same format so that all requests to any job will include the headers.

## Raw payload

Similarly to request headers, if the query args contain `raw=true`, then an additional argument will be added: `raw_string` which contains the entire json payload as a string (without any parsing). This is useful to verify the signature of the payload for example (discord require the endpoints to verify the signature for instance).
